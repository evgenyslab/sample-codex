# TODO's

- Implement Browser page
    - Broswer component needs to be two panes, left pane (narrow), right pane (wide)
    - left pane maybe add toggle on/off function
    - left pane has search bar at top
    - left pane shows a list of all tags
    - search bar narrows down tag list
    - clicking on tag applies filtering on browser samples with this tag and highlights its text 
    - left-clicking on tag highlights tag and adds an 'x' to the right of it, and uses an exclude filter on the samples
    - right panel has top-row search bar which will filter matches based on whats typed in
    - under the search bar is a virtualized table of all the samples, with columns 'name', 'duration', 'channels'
    - left and right panes should be separated by thin line, outline of left and right panes should have rounded corners, the hight of left and right pane can go below the display view
- Browser sample preview panel needed, need to show up at the bottom of the page, plot the sample wave form
